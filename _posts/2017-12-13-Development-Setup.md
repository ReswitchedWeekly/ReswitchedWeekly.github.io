title: Setup Development

This is an example of what it takes to setup up a reswitched development environment.

##Requirements

These are universal requirements needed for everything.
- LLVM and Clang Version 5 or higher.
Most likely or package manager is not up to date.
    - Arch is on version 5
    - Debian and Ubuntu are not.
        - You need to add the [official llvm apt](https://apt.llvm.org/)
        - I recommend setting llvm-5 and clang-5 as default but it isn't necessary.
- Python2 and Pip2
